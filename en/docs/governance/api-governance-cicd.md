# CI/CD-Driven API Governance

## API Governance with WSO2 APICTL

WSO2 APICTL is a command-line tool that enables you to manage APIs and microservices within the WSO2 API Manager.  
It provides a mechanism to automate governance validations as part of your CI/CD pipeline, 
helping enforce API governance policies consistently.

To ensure that an API complies with governance policies before it is imported, you can use the `--dry-run` 
flag with the `import` command. This performs a compliance check without actually importing the API and outputs a list 
of rule violations that must be addressed before the API can be successfully imported into the API Manager environment.

```bash
apictl import api --file <path-to-API-archive> --environment <environment> --dry-run
```

The results will be displayed in the console as shown in the example below:

</a>

!!! note "Applicable Governance Policies"
    In dry run mode, APIs are validated against all global policies configured in the target API Manager environment.

Integrating this step into your CI/CD pipeline helps ensure that only compliant APIs are promoted across environments, 
improving governance and reducing the risk of introducing faulty APIs.
