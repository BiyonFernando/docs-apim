# WSO2 API Management Governance

Governing how APIs are managed throughout their lifecycle has become a critical priority for many modern organizations. It encompasses a set of processes, practices, roles, and responsibilities aimed at ensuring the effective and efficient management of APIs. Establishing a governance strategy is essential for maintaining consistency, security, and compliance in API development, management, and consumption.

Such a governance strategy provides the following benefits:

- **Security and Compliance** – Enforces authentication, authorization, and regulatory compliance requirements.
- **Consistency** – Standardizes API design, documentation, and versioning to maintain uniformity.
- **Performance and Reliability** – Enables monitoring, rate limiting, and policy enforcement to ensure optimal API performance.
- **Lifecycle Management** – Supports structured API development, deployment, deprecation, and retirement processes.
- **Collaboration** – Defines clear roles and responsibilities for API stakeholders, improving coordination.
- **Discoverability and Reusability** – Facilitates API cataloging and reuse to minimize redundant development efforts.
- **Business Agility** – Accelerates API delivery, helping organizations meet customer and partner needs efficiently.
